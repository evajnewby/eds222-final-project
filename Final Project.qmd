![Rain in San Diego County brings Beach Closures from KPBS News](beach.jpg)

## Project Description

Coastal San Diego County is known for many things; most notable are it's world class beaches with surfable waves year-round, driving locals and tourist alike to the coast. San Diego is also known for it's mild climate, boasting warm winters with low precipitation. However, the effects of climate change have undoubtedly brought more extreme weather to the region, including precipitation. Growing up in north county San Diego as a surfer, I was taught to not enter the ocean for 48-72 hours after a "big rain", as the water was likely polluted. As climate change continues to affect the world, it is important to understand just how related rainfall is with extreme water quality advisories that warrant closing of a beach. 

The interaction I aim to assess is the cumulative amount of rain (in) from 2 coastal San Diego County stations, Oceanside Harbor and San Diego International Airport, compared to the total beach closure days for the beaches in San Diego County. The data was collected on a monthly basis from January 1, 2016 through April 1, 2020. The number of beach closure days (`total_closure_beach_days`) will be modeled as a function of the total rainfall (`rain_inch_total`) in the following analysis.

The water quality advisories data was accessed from San Diego County's online data catalog and is cited the "citations" section. The precipitation data for the two collection stations was accessed from the California Department of Water Resources Query System. 

# Outline

-   Load libraries
-   Load data
-   Explore and tidy data
-   Explore linear regression analysis
-   Conduct poisson analysis
-   (if poisson analysis suggests) conduct negative binomial regression analysis
-   Plot results
-   Explain results

```{r}
# Load Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(MASS) # for negative binomial regression
library(here)
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
```

## Load-in and Explore Data:

```{r}
# Read in data from data folder
wqa <- read_csv(here("data", "Department_of_Environmental_Health_Beach_Water_Quality_Advisories_20241203.csv")) %>% 
  mutate(Date = str_replace(Date, "AM", "")) %>% 
  mutate(Date = str_replace(Date, "12:00:00", ""))%>% 
 mutate(Date = str_trim(Date))

sd_precip <- read_csv(here("data", "SDG_PRECIP.csv")) 
```

## Clean Data:

```{r}
# Clean column names, convert to lower case
colnames(wqa) <- tolower(colnames(wqa))
colnames(sd_precip) <- tolower(colnames(sd_precip))

# Remove spaces
colnames(wqa) <- gsub(" ", "_", colnames(wqa))
colnames(sd_precip) <- gsub(" ", "_", colnames(sd_precip))

# Remove preceding zeros in wqa date column
wqa$date <- sub("^0", "", wqa$date)

```

```{r}
# Check class of date columns
print(class(sd_precip$date))
print(class(wqa$date))

# Convert from character to datetime
sd_precip$date <- mdy(sd_precip$date)
wqa$date <- mdy(wqa$date)

# Confirm conversion
print(class(sd_precip$date))
print(class(wqa$date))
```

```{r}
# Set days equal to the 1st, keep only months since we are doing a monthly analysis
wqa$date <- floor_date(wqa$date, unit = "month")
```

```{r}
# Remove columns we don't need
wqa <- subset(wqa, select = -c(fy, quarter))

sd_precip <- subset(sd_precip, select = -c(rain_inches_sd, rain_inches_osm))
```

Now that we have all our data tidy, let's join our tables together to prepare for further analysis.

```{r}
# Join tables
wqa_sd_precip <- full_join(wqa, sd_precip, by = "date")
```

# Linear Regression Analysis:

```{r}
# Plot raw data for beginner visualization
ggplot(data=wqa_sd_precip, aes(x = rain_inch_total, y = total_closure_beach_days)) +
  geom_point()+
  labs(x= "Rain (inches/month)",
       y = "Beach Closures (amount/month)",
      title = 'Linear Regression of Rain v Beach Closures in Coastal San Diego County (2016-2020)')+
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)+
  theme_minimal()
```

We may have jumped the gun with the above plot. Let's dig into some of the assumptions of linear regression to make sure that this is the best model for it.

```{r}
# Is our data normally distributed?
ggplot(data = wqa_sd_precip, aes(x = total_closure_beach_days))+
  geom_histogram()+
  labs(x = "Beach Closure Amount")
```

We can see above that the data is not normally distributed; the data is right-skewed. Additionally, our response variable is NOT a continuous variable, it's a count variable. This suggests that linear regression is not the best model for this analysis.

A poisson/negative binomial regression assumes the following: over-dispersion, the response variable is a count variable, observations are independent.

# Begin the Negative Binomial Regression Analysis:

Let's first check for over-dispersion in the data. If the variance exceeds the mean, then we can proceed with a negative binomial regression.

```{r}
# Fit Poisson model
poisson_model <- glm(total_closure_beach_days ~ rain_inch_total, family = poisson, data = wqa_sd_precip)

# Calculate dispersion statistic
dispersion <- sum(residuals(poisson_model, type = "pearson")^2) / poisson_model$df.residual

# If dispersion > 1, over-dispersion is present
dispersion
```

As the dispersion is 18.76, over-dispersion is present. We can continue with the negative binomial regression model as the poisson model does not account for over-dispersion.

```{r}
# Negative binomial regression model
model <- glm.nb(total_closure_beach_days ~ rain_inch_total, data = wqa_sd_precip)

summary(model)
```

```{r}
# Plot it
ggplot(data = wqa_sd_precip, aes(x = rain_inch_total, y = total_closure_beach_days)) +
  geom_point(color = "cornflowerblue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm.nb", se = FALSE, color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Rain (inches/month)", 
       y = "Beach Closures (amount/month)", 
       title = "Negative Binomial Regression of Rain v Beach Closures in Coastal San Diego County (2016-2020)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Negative Binomal Regression Model Interpretations:

The expected number of closure days with no rainfall is approximately 2.63 days. For each additional inch of rain, the log count of beach closure days increases by ~ 0.21 days. For each additional inch of rainfall, the expected number of beach closure days increases by about 23.2%. The y-intercept's p-value is 0.00376, meaning rainfall is statistically significant in predicting the number of beach closure days. 

What to do next? Rain is just one factor likely affecting beach closure days. From San Diego County's website regarding beach water quality advisories, "Advisories are issued when beach water quality may exceed health standards.  Closures are issued when sewage or other chemical spills impact or can potentially impact beach water quality". Adding in monthly data on sewage and/or chemical spills in the analysis would provide a more comprehensive picture of the factors affecting beach closure days. 

Data biases and limitations present in this analysis was the the omission/absence of monthly rainfall data for other weather stations near the coast in San Diego County. Gaining access to precipitation data for more than two weather stations was a challenge given the time frame of this project. For a more complete analysis, more weather data from the other stations in San Diego county, as well as data of sewage/chemical spills should be included. Sewage/chemical spill data should be tested for any evidence of omitted variable bias.
